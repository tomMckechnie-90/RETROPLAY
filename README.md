## Overview

This website is a gateway to the nostalgia of retro gaming by focusing on its unique charm and aesthetics. Through a dynamic and interactive design, it aims to capture visitors who love a classic game and want that nostalgic flash back or those who are just curious and want to see how it felt to be a gamer in the retro era. For myself this is hands-on learning exercise to develop and tune up on my coding skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the use of AI tools focusing on the visual appearance for an appealing and user-friendly interface.

### Target Audience

This website is designed for retro gamers, casual gamers and those who are curious aged 20-40 who just want to unwind and enjoy some classics during their spare time. The site will focus on visually engaging designs that capture that magic of the nostalgia when it comes to classic games while making sure it is accessible and easy to use for all users.
